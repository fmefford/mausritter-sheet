# TODO

## Extension for other races
Prepare for inventory extension (like for Hamster from https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home/hamsters). The goal is to free space under the inventory slots. This will allow to put there specific things like the 2 cheek slots of hamsters.
- Move bank in a tab after welcome.
- Put grit somewhere else...
- Add other races from **Player Species** by Gray Moth.

## Mobile
- Create an application really usable on tablets and smartphones.

## Misc
- Allow to roll a dice formula, like 2d6+3.
- Add network to allow everyone with the same table identifier to see dice rolls and other mice name.
- Autosave ? after each update; each N minutes ?
- Save history in slots too.
- Manage retrieving pips from bank (cost 1% price).
- Add wonderful stuff from [Tales from Moonshore](https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home)

# IDEAS
- Application for GM session sheet

# FUTURE
